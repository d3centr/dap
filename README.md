Blake is a R&D concept, use at your discretion.

## experiments
- **infrastructure** ~ Imperative configuration in bootstrap folder has been made immutable with system-wide blue-green deployment. This experiment attempts to reduce dev time spent on maintenance as it removes the need to manage state drift, i.e. no process is developed to handle updates across technologies and distributed systems. The system itself is immutable.
