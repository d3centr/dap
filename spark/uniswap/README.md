## DaP Tokenomics
*Why a built-in Uniswap integration?*

Uncompromising tokenomics provide historical data of live valuation in base tokens like ETH and USD across all pairs.\
\- no data provider, no aggregation, open-source prices straight from smart contract logs -\
This repo controls every bit of the data supply in full transparency.

Out of the DaP box, you can:
- value a token business
- analyse the microscopic scale of decentralized price updates
- measure changes of market exposure

every transaction, every Uni-swap, at any point in time.
